Problem 1 

Create a function that accept the sum of 2 set

create a variable that accept an empty array 

Use a for loop that iterates each set and pushes it to the empty array

Calculate the sum of all the set pused to the empty array

Return the sum




Problem 2

Create a function takes two vectors `v1` and `v2` as input and returns their dot product

create a function determines if two vectors are orthogonal and equal to zero

use a for of loop to iterate
